            Max is our energetic and loyal German Shepherd. He's always by our
            side, whether we're hiking in the woods or lounging on the couch.
            Known for their intelligence and trainability, German Shepherds make
            excellent working dogs, and Max is no exception. He loves to learn
            new tricks and is always up for a game of fetch.

            Roxy is a proud and strong Rottweiler. Though she has a fierce
            appearance, she is incredibly affectionate and loves to cuddle with
            us at the end of a long day. Rottweilers are known for their loyalty
            and protective instincts, and Roxy takes her role as a family
            protector seriously. She is always alert and attentive to anyone
            around us.

            Duke is our Great Dane, and he is truly a gentle giant. Despite his
            massive size, he is a sweetheart who loves being around people.
            Great Danes are known for their calm and easygoing nature, and Duke
            is no exception. He enjoys lounging on the couch and is always ready
            to give big, slobbery kisses to everyone who visits.
